          <h2>About Fleue</h2>
          <p>
            Fleue Studio is a celebration of nature's beauty transformed into wearable art.
            Inspired by the organic forms found in gardens and beaches, each piece is
            handcrafted with care and consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe in sustainable creation. Every piece of jewelry is made from
            recycled plastic bottles, giving new life to materials that would otherwise
            harm our environment. Through careful craftsmanship, we transform waste into
            unique, beautiful accessories that tell a story of renewal and respect for our planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each creation is one-of-a-kind, bearing the marks of its handmade journey
            and the natural inspirations that guide our work.
